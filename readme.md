# üèÄ Baller Quest

A basketball game that takes place in a medieval fantasy world.

## To do list

- Smarter offball (move to open zone, ask for pass)
- Player art (running, dribbling, shooting, defending, block)
- Driving layup logic

## Polish

- Shot clock after rebound starts at 23 instead of 24
- Have a little text card that plays during out of bounds or shot clock violations
- Box out during rebounds
- When two players collide, turn off colliders if they are "stuck" on each other for more than some time threshold

## Bugs

- Reset shot clock when possession of the ball changes due to steal/block
- Fix shot contest and shot percentages
- Inbounding sometimes causes stuck state
- Pass out of bounds results in crazy behavior sometimes
