A basketball game that takes place in a medieval fantasy world.

## To do list

- Smarter offball (move to open zone, ask for pass)
- Player art (running, dribbling, shooting, defending, block)

- Blocking, stealing
- Boxing out during rebounds
- Driving layup logic
- Shot make animation

## Polish / Minor bug fixes

- Fix colliders for the hoop
